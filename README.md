## Our Project
  We are currently working on a project named Mafqood, that aims to help the community to report missing/found individuals. There is an urgent need to organize the process of reporting missing, found or even kidnapped suspects in a single platform. This is currently being done through social networks, but it is lacking organization, and is done in a very scattered manner.
